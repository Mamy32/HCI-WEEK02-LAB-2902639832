                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/Bandung_View_dari_Gedung_Wisma_HSBC_Asia_Afrika_4.jpg/1920px-Bandung_View_dari_Gedung_Wisma_HSBC_Asia_Afrika_4.jpg"
                    width="800px" height="500px" alt="">
                <p><strong>Bandung</strong> is the capital city of the West Java province of Indonesia.[9] Located on
                    the island of Java, the city is the third largest city in Indonesia and Greater Bandung (Bandung
                    Basin Metropolitan Area / BBMA) is the country's second-largest and second most populous
                    metropolitan area, with over 11 million inhabitants.[10][5] Situated 768 meters (2,520 feet) above
                    sea level (the highest point in the North area is at an altitude of 1,050 meters (3,445 feet), and
                    the lowest in the South at 675 meters (2,215 feet) above sea level), approximately 135 kilometres
                    (84 miles) southeast of Jakarta, Bandung has cooler year-round temperatures than most other
                    Indonesian cities. The city lies in a river basin surrounded by volcanic mountains that provide a
                    natural defense system, which was the primary reason for the Dutch East Indies government's plan to
                    move the capital from Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) to Bandung.[11]

                    The Dutch first established tea plantations around the mountains in the 18th century, and a road was
                    constructed to connect the plantation area to the colonial capital Batavia (180 kilometres (112
                    miles) to the northwest). In the early 20th century, the Dutch inhabitants of Bandung demanded the
                    establishment of a municipality (gemeente), which was granted in 1906, and Bandung gradually
                    developed into a resort city for plantation owners. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, cafés, and
                    European boutiques were opened, leading the city to be nicknamed Parijs van Java (Dutch: "The Paris
                    of Java").

                    After Indonesia declared independence in 1945, the city experienced ongoing development and
                    urbanization, transforming from an idyllic town into a dense 16,500 people/km2 (per square
                    kilometer) metropolitan area with living space for over 8 million people. New skyscrapers, high-rise
                    buildings, bridges, and gardens have been constructed. Natural resources have been heavily
                    exploited, particularly by conversion of the protected upland area into highland villas and real
                    estate. Although the city has encountered many problems (ranging from waste disposal and floods to a
                    complicated traffic system resulting from a lack of road infrastructure), it still attracts large
                    numbers of tourists, weekend sightseers, and migrants from other parts of Indonesia. In 2017 the
                    city won a regional environmental sustainability award for having the cleanest air among major
                    cities in ASEAN.[12] The city is also known as a Smart City, leveraging technology to improve
                    government services and social media that alert residents to issues such as floods or traffic jams.
                    The city is part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network, which it joined in 2015.[13] Bandung is
                    Indonesia's major technology centre.[14][15][16]

                    The first Asian-African Conference, the Bandung Conference, was hosted in Bandung by President
                    Sukarno in 1955 and now decennial event. Redevelopment of the existing Husein Sastranegara
                    International Airport (BDO) was completed in 2016. The new larger second airport for Greater Bandung
                    Kertajati International Airport (KJT) opened in June 2018, just in time for the 2018 Asian
                    Games.[citation needed] </p>

                <p><strong>Yogyakarta</strong> is the capital city of the Special Region of Yogyakarta in Indonesia, in
                    the south-central part of the island of Java. As the only Indonesian royal city still ruled by a
                    monarchy, Yogyakarta is regarded as an important centre for classical Javanese fine arts and culture
                    such as ballet, batik textiles, drama, literature, music, poetry, silversmithing, visual arts, and
                    wayang puppetry.[6] Renowned as a centre of Indonesian education, Yogyakarta is home to a large
                    student population and dozens of schools and universities, including Gadjah Mada University, the
                    country's largest institute of higher education and one of its most prestigious.[7][8][9]

                    Yogyakarta is the capital of the Yogyakarta Sultanate and served as the Indonesian capital from 1946
                    to 1948 during the Indonesian National Revolution, with Gedung Agung as the president's office. One
                    of the districts in southeastern Yogyakarta, Kota, was the capital of the Mataram Sultanate between
                    1587 and 1613.

                    The city's population was 388,627 at the 2010 census,[10] and 373,589 at the 2020 census;[11] the
                    official estimate as of mid-2023 was 375,699, composed of 182,840 men and 192,859 women.[1] The
                    greater metropolitan area includes the city of Magelang and 65 districts across Sleman, Klaten,
                    Bantul, Kulon Progo and Magelang regencies and was home to 4,010,436 inhabitants in 2010. Yogyakarta
                    has the highest HDI (Human Development Index) of all Indonesian regencies and cities, with a score
                    of 0.887.[12] </p>

                <p>Jakarta[b] ( Indonesian pronunciation: [dʒakarta] ⓘ, Betawi: Jakartè), officially the
                    Specific Region of Jakarta[c] (Indonesian: Daerah Khusus Jakarta; DKJ) and formerly known as Batavia
                    until 1949, is the capital and largest city of Indonesia and an autonomous region at the provincial
                    level. Lying on the northwest coast of Java, the world's most populous island, Jakarta is the
                    largest metropole in Southeast Asia and serves as the diplomatic capital of ASEAN. The Specific
                    Region has a status equivalent to that of a province and is bordered by the province of West Java to
                    the south and east and Banten to the west. Its coastline faces the Java Sea to the north, and it
                    shares a maritime border with Lampung to the west. Jakarta's metropolitan area is ASEAN's second
                    largest economy after Singapore. In 2023, the city's GDP PPP was estimated at US$724.010 billion.

                    Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over
                    only 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi) and thus has the smallest area of any Indonesian province, its
                    metropolitan area covers 7,076.31 km2 (2,732.18 sq mi), which includes the satellite cities of
                    Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, South Tangerang, and Bekasi, and has an estimated population of 32.6
                    million as of 2022, making it the largest urban area in Indonesia and the second-largest in the
                    world (after Tokyo). Jakarta ranks first among the Indonesian provinces in the human development
                    index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a
                    potentially higher standard of living compared to other parts of the country, have attracted
                    migrants from across the Indonesian archipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

                    Jakarta is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the
                    fourth century as Sunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom. At
                    one time, it was the de facto capital of the Dutch East Indies, when it was known as Batavia.
                    Jakarta was officially a city within West Java until 1960 when its official status was changed to a
                    province with special capital region distinction. As a province, its government consists of five
                    administrative cities and one administrative regency. Jakarta is an alpha world city and the ASEAN
                    secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the Bank of Indonesia, Indonesia Stock Exchange,
                    and corporate headquarters of numerous Indonesian companies and multinational corporations are
                    located in the city. Jakarta, as Indonesias largest Muslim-majority city, is known for its
                    tradition of religious tolerance and pluralism. The Istiqlal Mosque, the largest in Southeast Asia,
                    stands as a symbol of the citys commitment to interfaith harmony.[12][13]
